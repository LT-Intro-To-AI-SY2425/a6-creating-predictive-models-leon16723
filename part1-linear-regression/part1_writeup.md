# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The R squred value is the linear version of the model, it tells us that what the predicted value will be however acurate it is depends on data given.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
The predicted value is somewhere around 135, while the actual value was actually somewhre around 1245
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model? 
It is okay, not the most acurate and esppically when it comes messuring someting as important as someones blood presuare acurate readings must be priortized, so i do not belive this model is acurate enough.
