## Questions to answer

1. Comment out the StandardScaler and re-run your test. How accurate is the model? Why is that?
My model is goes from being very acurate at around 88% percent to now being much lower only about 50, i belive this is because it does not scale correctly wich then scews the data making the predictons less acurate.
2. How accurate is the model with the StandardScaler? Is this model accurate enough for the given use case? Explain.
It is very acurtate it is around 88%, this is acurate enough for this case because it is not life or death situation and can be sued to predict car purchase.
3. Looking at the predicted and actual results, how did the model do? Was there a pattern to the inputs that the model was incorrect about?
The model did very well in most casses, what i noticed is that if there was major discrpencys between for example the wages and and then other data points it was more likely to get it wrong.
4. Would a 34 year old Female who makes 56000 a year buy an SUV according to the model? Remember to scale the data before running it through the model.
