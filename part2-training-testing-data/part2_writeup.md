# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more acruate as it shows us more of the data including the tranning data, testing data and then we also see the predicded data. and the fact that we split the data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It tells us how acurate the model is, for me i got that is was 0.63 or 63%. This makes it some what good at predictions.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say this model is deffientally more accurate. Just looking at the line from the graph i see the diffrience and same with the r squared value, I would not say that this is someting to be used in real world situatoins however as it is still inacurate and when it is about something this imporatant.
