# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
For the orange group i would call it the fakeflex, becasuse they are spneding alot but also make nothing, the green i would say is the broke, the blue is avrage joe, the purple is the rich but humble and the red is the realflex
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
i think they would be in the broke to avrage joe area as they both have low income but also dont spend much.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
i would say the realflex group as they have lots of money but also spend alot so they would be  aperfect group to target in order to make money.
